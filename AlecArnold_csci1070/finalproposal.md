1. I am working alone

My plan for working on this is by dedicating different days/weeks to completing the different aspects of the assignment. 

2. The dataset that I am going to use is GDP vs. Organized Crime.

3. My starting hypothesis about the data is that the lower the GDP of a country is, the higher prevalence of organized crime there will be. I also expect some outliers as a result of varying laws and other social factors within the countries.

Null: For the dataset GDP vs. organized crime, there will be no difference between GDP and instances of organized crime.

Alternative: For the dataset GDP vs. organized crime, there will be a difference in GDP and instances of organized crime.

4. The models that I plan to apply to my data first are linear regression based because of the nature of the data. The outcomes I am looking at are not really binary because there will always be at least SOME amount of organized crime in each country, so I will be working with more non binary outcomes.
